Disadvantages or drawbacks of JDBC :
    -> Biolerplate code
    -> No automatic table creation
    -> No ID generation
    -> Handle Checked Exception
    -> No cache memory
    -> Establishing the relation between multiple tables is very difficult

Hibernate :
    - Hibernate is a framework which helps in creating connection with database and do the CRUD operations.
    Features :
        -> Hibernate is ORM(Object Relational Mapping) tool.
        -> Establishing the relation between multiple tables is easy.
        -> Automatic table creation is available.
        -> Automatic ID generation is available.
        -> No need to Handle the Exceptions.
        -> Hibernate provides cache memory which helps in improving the performance of the application.
        -> It support dialect.
        -> It provides HQL(Hibernate Query Language) or JPQL(Java Persistence Query Language).

How does Hibernate works :
    - Hibernate uses JDBC internally to connect with the database and JDBC uses driver software to connect to database.

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) :
    - entity class is a class which is related to table in database.
    
    @entity
    class Student{
        @id  ---> primary key
        int id;
        String name;
        String email;
    
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setId(1);
        s.setName("Rahul");
        s.setEmail("rahul@gmail.com");
    }

    - In ORM(Object Relational Mapping) the entity class will be represented as or mapped with database table.
    - In this case the entity class name will be represented as table name.
    - Every variables of this class will be represented as columns inside the table.
    - The datatype of each variable will be represented as datatype of the respective column.
    - An Object of this entity class will be represented as rows inside the table.

Rules to create entity class :
    - The class should be of public and non-abstract.
    - This class should be anotated with @entity anotation.
    - This class should have one ID that can be created by using @id anotation which is represented as primary key.
    - Each and Every variables in entity class should have getters and setters.
    - This class should contain zero parameterized contructors or default contructor.
